This is a toy project to learn Ruby via the investigation of some 20,000 bridge PBN files
which contain Deal and OptimumResultTable tags.

Part of the Ruby education includes dependency management, and as such this ruby code depends
on the gems bridge by Daniel Evans, and bridge-pbn by yours truly.
